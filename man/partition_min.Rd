\title{Generation of conservative or parsimonious solution for individual
partitions}
\usage{
partition_min(
  dataset,
  units,
  time,
  cond,
  out,
  n_cut,
  incl_cut,
  solution,
  BE_cons,
  WI_cons,
  BE_ncut,
  WI_ncut
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Calibrated pooled dataset that is partitioned and minimized for
deriving the pooled solution.}

\item{units}{Units defining the within-dimension of data (time series). If no
units are specified, the data is assumed to lack a dimension and be
hierarchical.}

\item{time}{Periods defining the between-dimension of data (cross sections).
This should be specified because it does not make sense to partition a
time series into individual data points.}

\item{cond}{Conditions used for minimization}

\item{out}{Outcome used for minimization}

\item{n_cut}{Frequency cut-off for designating truth table rows as observed
as opposed to designating them as remainders for the \emph{pooled} data.}

\item{incl_cut}{Inclusion (a.k.a. consistency) cut-off for designating
truth table rows as consistent for the \emph{pooled} data.}

\item{solution}{A character specifying the type of solution that should
be derived. \code{C} produces the conservative (or complex) solution,
\code{P} for the parsimonious solution. See \code{\link{partition_min_inter}}
for a separate function for the intermediate solution.}

\item{BE_cons}{Inclusion thresholds for creating an individual truth table
for each cross section.
They must be specified as a numeric vector. Its length should be
equal the number of cross sections. The order of thresholds corresponds
to the order of the cross sections in the data defined by the cross-section
ID in the dataset (such as years in ascending order).}

\item{WI_cons}{Inclusion thresholds for creating an individual truth table
for each time series.
They must be specified as a numeric vector. Its length should be
equal the number of time series. The order of thresholds corresponds
to the order of the of the time-series (unit) ID
in the dataset (such as countries in alphabetical order).}

\item{BE_ncut}{For \emph{cross sections}, the minimum number of members needed
for declaring a truth table row
as relevant as opposed to designating it as a remainder.
Must be specified as a numeric vector. Its length should be
equal the number of cross sections. The order of thresholds corresponds
to the order of the cross sections in the data defined by the cross-section
ID in the dataset (such as years in ascending order).}

\item{WI_ncut}{For \emph{time series}, the minimum number of members needed
for declaring a truth table row
as relevant as opposed to designating it as a remainder.
Must be specified as a numeric vector. Its length should be
equal the number of time series. The order of thresholds corresponds
to the order of the of the time-series (unit) ID
in the dataset (such as countries in alphabetical order).}
}
\value{
A dataframe summarizing the partition-specific and pooled solutions
with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: The type of the partition. \code{pooled} are rows with information
on the pooled data; \code{between} is for cross-section partitions;
\code{within} is for time-series partitions
\item \code{partition}: Specific dimension of the partition at hand. For
between-dimension, the unit identifiers are included here  (argument \code{units}).
For the within-dimension, the time identifier are listed (argument \code{time}).
The entry is \code{-} for the pooled data without partitions.
\item \code{solution}: The solution derived for the partition or the pooled data.
Absence of a condition is denoted by the \code{~} sign.
\item \code{model}: Running ID for models. In the presence of model ambiguity, each
model has its own row with its individual solution and parameters. The rest of
the information in the row is duplicated, for example by having two rows for
the within-partition 1996. The column \code{model} highlights the presence of
model ambiguity by numbering all models belonging to the same solution. For
example, if three consecutive rows are numbered 1, 2 and 3, then these rows
belong to the same solution and represent model ambiguity. If a 1 in a row
is followed by another 1, then there is no model ambiguity.
\item \code{consistency}: The consistency score (a.k.a. inclusion score)
for the partition of the data or the pooled data.
\item \code{coverage}: The coverage score for the partition of the data
or the pooled data.
}

\description{
\code{partition_min} decomposes clustered data into individual
partitions. For panel data, for example, these can be cross sections,
time series or both. The function derives an individual solution for
each partition and the pooled data to assess the robustness of the
solutions in a comparative perspective.
