Description: Clustered set-relational data can have a hierarchical structure, a 
    panel structure or be repeated cross sections. QCAcluster allows empirical 
    researchers 
    to supplement a pooled analysis of the data with a disaggregated perspective.
    The pooled data can be partitioned along the dimensions of the clustered data
    (individual cross sections or time series) to perform partition-specific 
    truth table minimizations. Empirical researchers can further calculate 
    the weight that each partition has on the parameters of the pooled solution 
    and the diversity of the cases under analysis within and across partitions.
