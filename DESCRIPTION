Description: Clustered set-relational data can be hierarchical data, panel 
    data or repeated cross sections. The package allows empirical researchers 
    to supplement a pooled analysis of the data with a disaggregated perspective.
    The pooled data can be partitioned along the dimensions of the clustered data
    (individual cross sections or time series) and partition-specific truth table 
    minimizations can be performed. Empirical researchers can further calculate 
    the weight that each partition has on the parameters of the pooled solution 
    and the diversity of the cases within and across partitions.
