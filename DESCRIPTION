Description: Clustered set-relational data can have a hierarchical structure, a 
    panel structure or repeated cross sections. QCAcluster allows empirical 
    researchers to supplement the analysis of pooled the data with a 
    disaggregated perspective focusing on selected partitions of the data.
    The pooled data can be partitioned along the dimensions of the clustered data
    (individual cross sections or time series) to perform partition-specific 
    truth table minimizations. Empirical researchers can further calculate 
    the weight that each partition has on the parameters of the pooled solution 
    and the diversity of the cases under analysis within and across partitions.
