# QCAcluster  
**Contributors: Jan Schwalbach, Ingo Rohlfing, Ayjeren Rozyjumayeva**  
Clustered data can take different forms in empirical research. The data might
have a hierarchical structure (lower-level units nested in higher-level units);
we might have multiple units nested in time (panel data); or the combination of 
both. `QCAcluster` includes multiple tools for the analysis of clustered data
in empirical research that works with sets (commonly known as QCA). The use of
the tools promises insights that would go unnoticed in a pooled analysis ignoring
the clusters in the data.

**This is work in progress.**

**Internal notes**

- Vignette now uses formattable(). I guess it needs to be suggested 
in the DESCRIPTION?
