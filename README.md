## Description of package

Clustered data can take different forms in empirical research. The data
might have a hierarchical structure (lower-level units nested in
higher-level units); we might have multiple units nested in time (panel
data); or the combination of both. The R package `QCAcluster` includes
multiple tools for the analysis of clustered data in *Qualitative
Comparative Analysis*. The use of the tools promises insights that would
go unnoticed in a pooled analysis ignoring the clusters in the data.

This is work in progress. You can download the development version
0.9.0.

``` r
devtools::install_github("ingorohlfing/QCAcluster")
```
