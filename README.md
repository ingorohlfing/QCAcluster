Clustered data can take different forms in empirical research. The data might
have a hierarchical structure (lower-level units nested in higher-level units);
we might have multiple units nested in time (panel data); or the combination of 
both. `QCAcluster` includes multiple tools for the analysis of clustered data
that might yield insights that would go unnoticed in a pooled analysis ignoring
the clusters.
