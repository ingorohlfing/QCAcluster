# QCAcluster  

Clustered data can take different forms in empirical research. The data might
have a hierarchical structure (lower-level units nested in higher-level units);
we might have multiple units nested in time (panel data); or the combination of 
both. The R package `QCAcluster` includes multiple tools for the analysis of 
clustered data in *Qualitative Comparative Analysis*. The use of
the tools promises insights that would go unnoticed in a pooled analysis
ignoring the clusters in the data.
